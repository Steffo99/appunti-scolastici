### Sum up in 10 lines how web addresses work
Web Addresses, or Universal Resource Locators (URLs), are used to find a 
specific computer on the Net through the use of a easy to remember name.

A web URL is formed by four parts: the first, the protocol (`http(s)://`), tells
the browser what protocol should it use to retrieve the web page; the second, the
address, is composed by multiple domains, each of a different level, starting 
with the highest level one (`www[3rd].youtube[2nd].com[1st]`); the third, the path, tells
the website what page should it send back to the requesting browser (`/watch`);
finally, the last part are additional parameters sent by the browser that are used
by the server to dynamically modify parts of the selected page (`?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`).

### Sum up in 10 lines the various methods of connecting to the Internet
Currently, the main methods used to connect to the Internet are ASDL, fiber optic, satellite and LTE (also called 4G or H).

Satellite requires a satellite dish, and is the slowest of the four, but can be used to have Internet access on any location where the sky is visible.

ASDL once was the best option for most Internet users: it allowed medium speeds and latency while being relatively cheap since the data was sent through the phone lines.

LTE is currently the most used method and it's faster than ASDL while requiring only an antenna (already integrated in most cellphones), but it can be quite expensive because most providers limit the usage to a really small quantity of data.

Fiber optic is the fastest of the four: data travels in form of beams of light passing through a really expensive reflective glass wire.
