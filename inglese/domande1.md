### Sum up in 10 lines how the Internet developed
The Internet originally was a decentralized military network called
ARPANET that interconnected military sites across the USA.

Its development began in the 1960s, during the Cold War, in order to have a functioning communications network even if one of the nodes got taken down by a Russian attack. 

The network was later connected to all the universities in the US, thanks to the new TCP/IP protocol suite.

The network kept expanding: multiple countries joined it, and thanks to the creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee a whole world of new opportunities was opened and led to the spread of the Internet in both homes and companies.

### Sum up in 10 lines how the Internet works
The Internet is composed of millions of devices called routers whose task is 
directing the data towards its destination.

This task is fulfilled by the IP protocol through a technique called "packet 
switching": the data to be sent is split in multiple fragments of the same size 
("packets"), and a source address and a destination address is added to each 
packet, in order to allow the routers to find a path in the network towards the
destination and allow the receiving device to answer the message.

This packet switching can be seen clearly when you watch a video on the Internet. 
You can see that the video loads in blocks around 5-6 seconds long: those blocks
are the packets that have reached your device and have been stored in the memory 
of your computer.
